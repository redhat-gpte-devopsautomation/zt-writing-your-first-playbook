= 1.9 - Roles

This exercise builds upon previous exercises by guiding you through the creation of an Ansible role to configure Apache (*httpd*). You'll integrate variables, handlers, and a Jinja2 template for a custom *index.html*, demonstrating the encapsulation of tasks into a reusable structure for automation.


== Hands-On Experience

======
.☑️ Task 1 - Create a Basic Role Directory Structure
[%collapsible]
=====

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Ansible looks for roles in a subdirectory called *roles* in the project directory by default. To create a new role, use *ansible-galaxy*.
* Ansible Galaxy is your hub for finding, reusing and sharing Ansible content.
====

. Ensure you are on the **Control** tab
. In the ansible-files directory create a new directory called **roles**.
+
[source,shell]
----
cd /home/rhel/ansible-files
----
+
[source,shell]
----
mkdir roles
----

. Once the roles directory is created, use ansible-galaxy to build a role labeled apache
+
[source,shell]
----
ansible-galaxy init --offline roles/apache
----
=====
======

======
.☑️ Task 2 - View apache Role Directory Structure
[%collapsible]
=====
NOTE: In the **Control** tab

. Use the *tree* command to view the role directory structure.
+
[source,shell]
----
tree roles
----

+
.Output of the tree command
[source,shell]

======
.☑️ Task 3 - Edit the roles/apache/vars/main.yml file
[%collapsible]
=====
NOTE: In **VSCode Editor** tab

. Edit *ansible-files/roles/apache/vars/main.yml*:
+
[source,yaml]
----
---
# vars file for roles/apache
apache_package_name: httpd
apache_service_name: httpd
----
=====
======


======
.☑️ Task 4 - Edit the roles/apache/tasks/main.yml file
[%collapsible]
=====
[NOTE]
====
* Previously we would include all of our tasks within the Ansible playbook itself. With Ansible Roles, we include the tasks within the *roles/apache/tasks/main.yml* file. This file only has the tasks and is not a complete playbook.

* For this challenge, the *roles/apache/tasks/main.yml* file includes tasks that do the following:
+
** Make sure httpd is installed
** Make sure httpd is started and enabled
** Make sure firewalld is installed
** Make sure firewalld is started and enabled
** Allow HTTPS traffic on web servers
====


. Edit *ansible-files/roles/apache/tasks/main.yml* to include tasks:
+
[source,yaml]
----
---
# tasks file for ansible-files/roles/apache
- name: Install Apache web server
  ansible.builtin.package:
    name: "{{ apache_package_name }}"
    state: present

- name: Ensure Apache is running and enabled
  ansible.builtin.service:
    name: "{{ apache_service_name }}"
    state: started
    enabled: true

- name: Install firewalld
  ansible.builtin.dnf:
    name: firewalld
    state: present

- name: Ensure firewalld is running
  ansible.builtin.service:
    name: firewalld
    state: started
    enabled: true

- name: Allow HTTP traffic on web servers
  ansible.posix.firewalld:
    service: http
    permanent: true
    state: enabled
  when: inventory_hostname in groups['web']
  notify: Reload Firewall
----

======
.☑️ Task 5 - Create the handlers
[%collapsible]
=====
. In *ansible-files/roles/apache/handlers/main.yml*, create a handler to restart firewalld if its configuration changes:
+
[source,yaml]
----
---
# handlers file for ansible-files/roles/apache
- name: Reload Firewall
  ansible.builtin.service:
    name: firewalld
    state: reloaded
----
=====
======


======
.☑️ Task 6 - Creating an index.html Jinja2 template file
[%collapsible]
=====
NOTE: Ansible uses Jinja2 templating to enable dynamic expressions and access to variables and facts. You can use templating with the *template* module. We will use a Jinja2 template to create a custom *index.html*. Let's create the file and store it in the apache role directory:

. Create a new file *ansible-files/roles/apache/templates/index.html.j2* with the following content:
+
[source,html]
----
<html>
<head>
<title>Welcome to {{ ansible_hostname }}</title>
</head>
<body>
 <h1>Hello from {{ ansible_hostname }}</h1>
</body>
</html>
----


NOTE: You will notice we are using an Ansible variable in that HTML code above: *{{ ansible_hostname }}*, this will be replaced at runtime by the corresponding value.
=====
======


======
.☑️ Task 7 - Add the deploy index.html task into the tasks/main.yml file
[%collapsible]
=====
. In the *ansible-files/roles/apache/tasks/main.yml* file, add the following task at the end:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Pay attention to indentation. When pressing enter in VSCode some extra spaces might be added!
====

+
[source,yaml]
----
- name: Deploy custom index.html
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: index.html.j2
    dest: /var/www/html/index.html

----
=====
======


======
.☑️ Task 8 - Create a new playbook called deploy_apache.yml to use the new *apache* role
[%collapsible]
=====
. Create a new playbook named *deploy_apache.yml* in the *ansible-files* directory with the following content:
+
IMPORTANT: All we need to do to use our role is call it under the *roles:* declarative with its name *apache*

+
[source,yaml]
----
---
- name: Setup Apache Web Servers
  hosts: web
  become: true
  roles:
    - apache
----
=====
======


======
.☑️ Task 9 - Run Ansible playbook
[%collapsible]
=====
NOTE: In the **Control** tab

. Run the playbook.
+
[source,shell]
----
ansible-navigator run deploy_apache.yml
----
=====
======


======
.☑️ Task 10 - Verify the results
[%collapsible]
=====
. Once the playbook has completed, verify that httpd is indeed running on all the web nodes.

+
*Check node1:*
+
[source,shell]
----
ssh node1 "systemctl status httpd"
----

+
[source,shell]
----
curl http://node1
----

+
*Check node2:*
+
[source,shell]
----
ssh node2 "systemctl status httpd"
----
+
[source,shell]
----
curl http://node2
----
