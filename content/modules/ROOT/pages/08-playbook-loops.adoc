= 1.7 - Loops in Ansible

Loops in Ansible allow you to perform a task multiple times with different values. This feature is particularly useful for tasks like creating multiple user accounts in our given example.

In this challenge, you will create a simple loop that generates three new users on *node1*, instead of a single one.

== Hands-On Experience

======
.☑️ Task 1 - Create a new playbook
[%collapsible]
=====
NOTE: In the *VSCode Editor* tab

. Create the file *loop_users.yml*, This can be done by simply right clicking and selecting 'New File', with the following content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
---
- name: Create multiple users with a loop
  hosts: node1
  become: true

  tasks:
    - name: Create a new user
      ansible.builtin.user:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
        create_home: true
      loop:
        - alice
        - bob
        - carol
----

[NOTE]
====
. The playbook takes advantage of the *ansible.builtin.user* module to create users on the *node1* host.

. Notice the *name: "{{ item }}"*? This is a special variable named *{{ item }}*. This variable *item* gets replaced with the values found under the *loop:* statement.

. What changed from our original task creating a single user?
+
* Loop Directive: The *loop* keyword is used to iterate over a list of items. In this case, the list contains the names of users we want to create: alice, bob, and carol.
* User Creation with Loop: Instead of creating a single user, the modified task now iterates over each item in the loop list. The *{{ item }}* placeholder is dynamically replaced with each username in the list on each iteration, so the *ansible.builtin.user* module creates each user in turn.

======
.☑️ Task 2 - Run the loop_users.yml playbook
[%collapsible]
=====
NOTE: In the *Control* tab

. Change directory to *ansible-files* and run the *loop_users.yml* playbook.
+
[source,shell]
----
cd ansible-files
----
+
[source,shell]
----
ansible-navigator run loop_users.yml
----

[NOTE]
====
Understand the playbook and the output:

* The names are not provided to the *ansible.builtin.user* module directly. Instead, there is only a variable called *{{ item }}* for the parameter name.
* The *loop* keyword lists the actual user names *[alice, bob, carol]*. Those replace the *{{ item }}* during the actual execution of the playbook.
* During execution the task is only listed once, but there are three changes listed underneath it.
